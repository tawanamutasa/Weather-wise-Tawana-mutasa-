        "Throughout the development of my weather forecasting application, I utilized ChatGPT extensively to support both my understanding of the coding process and to moreover understand and fix any errors that arose during development.ChatGPT was instrumental in breaking down any complex programming concepts and provided guidance when I encountered syntax issues or logic errors. In addition to ChatGPT, I also used the autocomplete AI functionality provided by Google Colab, particularly when writing docstrings and explaining functions; which furthermore helped to enhance the readability and documentation of my code.\n",

        "One of the key features of my application was its emphasis on visual communication. When retrieving and presenting weather data, the program outputs graphical representations of hourly temperature forecasts based on the city selected by the user. This form of data visualization is not only user-friendly but also transcends language barriers, making the information more accessible and intuitive for a wider audience. The user simply inputs their city of interest, and the application generates a clear and engaging graph using the matplotlib library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation of matplotlib is a personal highlight of this project. Initially, I struggled to grasp how to effectively use this library when it was introduced in class. At the time, I found its syntax and configuration quite confusing. However, during the development of this application, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortably I was able to implement it with minimal errors. This stark improvement demonstrated how much progress I have made since the beginning of the course and gave me a significant boost in confidence regarding my technical skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I had more time, I would have explored additional ways to integrate artificial intelligence into the application, particularly to enhance the visual output and make the user experience even more dynamic. More importantly, it would have allowed me to deepen my understanding of AI’s transformative role in today’s business environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project shifted my previously skeptical view of artificial intelligence. I came to realize that AI should not be feared or dismissed, but rather embraced as a powerful tool capable of supporting day to day business operations and helping innovation in an increasingly digital and competitive economy."
